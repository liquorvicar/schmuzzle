<h1>Schmuzzle</h1>
<p>This is a library created following an episode of the Loosely Coupled podcast (episode 21, on iTunes but not 
currently on their website).</p>
<p>It's not intended for production use! But if you want to contribute, feel free to open a pull request. I can't 
guarantee how long it'll take me to look at your PR but I will try and get round to it eventually.</p>
<p>Contribution guidelines:
<ul><li>Code to be PSR-2 compatible</li>
<li>All code to be unit-tested using PHPUnit</li></ul>
